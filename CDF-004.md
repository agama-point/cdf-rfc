## Abstract
Define how to save CDF in RFID chips

# Motivation
In order to backward compatibility with old RFID records where first text record is BTC/LTC private key, we need some better concept how to make co-exists of those two technologies (on-chain and LN) on same RFID chip.


## Data format
- We will use NDEF records, each record will use mime type as defined in #CDF-003

## Usage
- If found more than one record, Interactive ATM/POS may show user to select based on index (or label if used) which record to use
- Non-interactive ATM/POS will use first record
