## Motivation

Create data format primary for lightning network and cryptocurrency ATMs / PoS terminals and general data exchange.
This format is primary for machine2machine communication, can be utilized e.g. by NFC technology.

## Specifications

Format is specified in individual CDF documents within this repository. It defines data format for enabling LN transactions via [LNURL](https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc) and (legacy) onchain transactions with raw private keys.  
Currently, specs include [general major type](/CDF-002.md) `cdf`, [minor types](/CDF-003.md) for certain BTC onchain and LN related payloads and [method](/CDF-004.md) of using them in NFC chips with backwards compatibility.
