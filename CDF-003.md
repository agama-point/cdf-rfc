## Motivation
Because this data format was created also for Lightning payments. We introduce first minor types

All lnurl records will be in URI format, not bech32 to safe space in RFID chips. In machine-machine communication is no reason to use bech32 format at all

cdf/lnp
 - Pay url
 - used to charge satoshis into RFID wallet
 - optional label separated by :
 - Example: "Wallet1:https://mywallet.example.org/payurl?id=123"
 - Example: "https://mywallet.example.org/payurl?id=123"

cdf/lnw
 - Withdrawal url
 - used to pay on POS/Weding machine etc by RFID
 - rest same as lnurl/p

cdf/lnpb
 - Base (prefix) URL
 - Used to save space in other records
 - Example: "https://mycoolnode.example.org/lnbitsinstance/"
 
cdf/lnpp
 - Prefixed Pay
 - Pay URL suffix
 - example: "Wallet 1:/lnpay?someid=123"
 
 
cdf/lnpw
 - Prefixed Withdrawal
 - Withdrawal URL suffix
 - example: "Wallet 1:/lnwithdraw?someid=123"


cdf/pk[coin]
 - private key for [coin]
 - [coin] is full coin name
 - used as compaitbility for POS or ATM for on-chain transactions on offline data storage (eg RFID tag)
 - can use ":" delimiter for labeling, same as cdf/lnp for example

cdf/p[coin]
 - public key for [coin]
 - rest same as cdf/pk[coin]
