## Motivation

This data format supports various kinds of transactions - Lightning using LNURL and onchain with pub/priv keys. Multiple technologies in one memory unit requires clear differentiating between them. We introduce first minor types. 

### LNURL 

All lnurl records will be in `URI` format, not bech32 to safe space in RFID chips. In machine-machine communication is no reason to use bech32 format at all. URL must use URL encoded `;` semicolon symbol if used.

With distinguished lnurlp and lnurlw records, one memory unit can be used to both receive and withdraw funds without LUD-19. 

Optional labels may be separated by semicolon delimiter `;`.

## Minor types


|   Mime type    | Description                                      |
| :------------: | ------------------------------------------------ |
|    cdf/lnp     | Pay url HIP-XX "Legacy"                          |
|    cdf/lnw     | Withdrawal url HIP-XX "Legacy"                   |
|    cdf/lnpb    | Base (prefix) URL                                |
|    cdf/lnpp    | Prefixed pay                                     |
|    cdf/lnpw    | Prefixed withdrawal                              |
|  cdf/pk[coin]  | Private key for [coin] (cdf/pkbitcoin - bitcoin) |
|  cdf/p[coin]   | Public key for [coin] (cdf/pbitcoin - bitcoin)   |

**cdf/lnp**

- Pay url
- used to charge satoshis into RFID wallet
- Example: "Wallet1;https://mywallet.example.org/payurl?id=123"
- Example: "https://mywallet.example.org/payurl?id=123"

**cdf/lnw**

- Withdrawal url
- used to pay on POS/Weding machine etc by RFID
- rest same as lnurl/p

**cdf/lnpb**

- Base (prefix) URL
- Used to save space in other records
- Example: "https://mycoolnode.example.org/lnbitsinstance/"

**cdf/lnpp**

- Prefixed Pay
- Pay URL suffix
- example: "Wallet 1;/lnpay?someid=123"

**cdf/lnpw**

- Prefixed Withdrawal
- Withdrawal URL suffix
- example: "Wallet 1;/lnwithdraw?someid=123"

**cdf/pk[coin]**

- private key for [coin]
- [coin] is full coin name
- used as compaitbility for POS or ATM for on-chain transactions on offline data storage (eg RFID tag)
- example: "cdf/pkbitcoin" pKl..

**cdf/p[coin]**

- public key for `[coin]`
- rest same as cdf/pk`[coin]`
